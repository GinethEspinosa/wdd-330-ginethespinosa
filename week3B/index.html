                <h3>Ch8: Forms</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Forms are the primary method used for entering data into a browser.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Forms have a variety of controls that are used for entering different types of information.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        HTML5 has a large number of new input types that are beginning to be implemented in modern browsers.
                    </li>
                    document.forms will return an HTML collection of all the forms on a page.
                    <li>
                        form.elements will return an HTML collection of all the elements contained within a form.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Forms have focus , blur , and change events that fire as a user interacts with the form.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Forms also have a submit event that can be used to intercept a form before itâ€™s been submitted.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The information entered into a form can be read or updated using the value property of the form controls.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The HTML5 form validation API can be used to automatically validate a form, but only at a basic level, so a custom validation script may be required.
                    </li>
                    

        
    </ol>
    <h3>Client-side form validation </h3>
    <p>Client-side form validation sometimes requires JavaScript if you want to customize styling and error messages, but it always requires you to think carefully about the user. Always remember to help your users correct the data they provide. To that end, be sure to:</p>
<ol><li>Display explicit error messages.</li>
<li>Be permissive about the input format.</li>
<li>Point out exactly where the error occurs, especially on large forms.</li></ol>
