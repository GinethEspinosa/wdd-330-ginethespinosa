    <p> In a browser environment the global object is the window object, which represents the browser window that
        contains a web page.

    </p>
    <p>In this chapter we will cover these topics:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The Browser Object Model</li>
        <li>Finding out browser information</li>
        <li>Browser history</li>
        <li>Controlling windows</li>
        <li>Cookies</li>
        <li>Timing functions</li>

    </ol>
    <h3>The Browser Object Model</h3>
    <p>The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and methods that contain information
        about the browser and computer screen. For example, we can find out which browser is being used to view a page
        (though, this method is unreliable). We can also find out the dimensions of the screen it is viewed on, and
        which pages have been visited before the current page. It can also be used for the rather dubious practice of
        creating pop-up windows, if you’re into annoying your users.<br><b>The BOM Only Makes Sense in a Browser
            Environment</b>
        <br>Example<br>
        <br><img src="bom.png" alt="example">
    </p>
    <h3>Going Global</h3>
    <p>These are variables that are created without using the const, let or var keywords. Global variables can be
        accessed in all parts of the program.<br>Global variables are actual properties of a global object. In a browser
        environment, the global object is the window object. This means that any global variable created is actually a
        property of the window object, as can be seen in the example below: <br><img src="gV.png" alt="example"></p>
    <h3>Browser Information</h3>
    <p>The window object has a number of properties and methods that provide information about the user’s browser.
        <b>Which Browser?</b>The window object has a navigator property that returns a reference to the Navigator
        object. The Navigator object contains information about the browser being used. Its userAgent property will
        return information about the browser and operating system being used.<br>
        <li>The window.alert() method will pause the execution of the program and display a message in a dialog box. The
            message is provided as an argument to the method, and undefined is always returned.</li>
        <li>The window.confirm() method will stop the execution of the program and display a confirmation dialog that
            shows the message provided as an argument, and giving the options of OK or Cancel</li>
        <li>The window.prompt() method will stop the execution of the program. It displays a dialog that shows a message
            provided as an argument, as well as an input field that allows the user to enter text. This text is then
            returned as a string when the user clicks OK. If the user clicks Cancel, null is returned</li>

        <li>The window.location property is an object that contains information about the URL of the current page. It
            contains a number of properties that provide information about different fragments of the URL.</li>
    </p>
    <h3>The Browser History</h3>
    <p>The window.history property can be used to access information about any previously visited pages in the current
        browser session.<br> A new window can be opened using the window.open() method. This takes the URL of the page
        to be opened as its first parameter, the window title as its second parameter, and a list of attributes as the
        third parameter. This can also be assigned to a variable, so the window can then be referenced later in the code
    </p>
    <h3>Controlling Windows</h3>
    <p> new window can be opened using the window.open() method. This takes the URL of the page to be opened as its
        first parameter, the window title as its second parameter, and a list of attributes as the third parameter. This
        can also be assigned to a variable, so the window can then be referenced later in the code</p>
    <h3> Cookies</h3>
    <p>Cookies are small files that are saved locally on a user’s computer. They were invented by Netscape as a way of
        getting round HTTP being a stateless protocol. This means that a browser does not remember anything from one
        request to another. So every time a user visits a page, nothing about any previous visits is remembered. Cookies
        can be used to sidestep this problem by storing information that can then be retrieved between requests.</p>
    <h3>Animation</h3>
    <p>The setTimeOut() and setInterval() methods can be used to animate elements on a web page. As an example, let’s
        create a web page that shows a colored square, and make it rotate. Create a folder called animation that
        contains files called index.html, styles.css and main.js. Place the following code inside index.html:<br><img
            src="exampleanimation.png" alt="example">
        This places a div on the page with an ID of square.<br>
        Next, add the following styles.css:<br><img src="example 2.png" alt="example"><br>This will set the position,
        dimensions and color of the div. Now for the animation ― add the following code to main.js:<br>
        <img src="example3.png" alt="example"><br>Open animation.html in your browser and you should see a rotating
        square, although it will probably be quite slow and not very smooth. This was the only way to achieve animation
        using JavaScript until the window.requestAnimationFrame() method was developed.
    </p>

    <h3> Reminders</h3>
    <li>The window object is the global object in a browser.</li>
    <li>Global variables are actually properties of the window object in a browser environment.</li>
    <li>alert, confirm(), and prompt() are all methods of the window object, and open dialogs that halt the execution of
        the program.</li>
    <li>The window.navigator object gives information about the user’s browser and operating system, although it can be
        unreliable.</li>
    <li>The window.location object provides information about the URL of the current page.</li>
    <li>The window.history object keeps information about the pages that have been visited in the session.</li>
    <li>You can open, close, resize, and move windows (although, this doesn’t mean you should!).</li>
    <li>The window.screen object provides information about the user’s screen.</li>
    <li>document.write() is an archaic method of writing text to the document and should be avoided.</li>
    <li>Cookies can be used to store small pieces of information between requests using the document.cookie property.
    </li>
    <li>The window.setTimeout() method can be used to invoke a function after a set amount of time. It can be canceled
        using the clearTimeout() method.</li>
    <li>The window.setInterval() method can be used to repeatedly invoke a function. It can be stopped using the
        clearInterval() method.</li>
    <li>The window.requestAnimationFrame() method can be used to produce smooth and optimized animation by utilizing the
        browser's built-in graphics capabilities. It can be canceled using the cancelAnimationFrame() method.</li>

    <h3> The Content Template element</h3>
    <p>Think of a template as a content fragment that is being stored for subsequent use in the document. While the
        parser does process the contents of the template element while loading the page, it does so only to ensure
            that those contents are valid; the element's contents are not rendered, however.</p>
    <p>Attributes<br>
        This element only includes the <b>global attributes.</b><br>

        However, the HTMLTemplateElement has a content property, which is a read-only DocumentFragment containing the
        DOM subtree which the template represents. Note that directly using the value of the content could lead to
        unexpected behavior.</p><br>
