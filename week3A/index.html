    <ol>
        <li>
            Ajax is a technique for sending and receiving data asynchronously in the background.
        </li>
        <li>
            The data can be sent in many forms, but it is usually in JSON.
        </li>
        <li>
            Ajax can be used for making partial page updates without having to do a full page reload.
        </li>
        <li>
            Ajax can be used for communicating with external APIs.
        </li>
        <li>
            Ajax requests can be made using the Fetch API.
        </li>

            The Response interface allows you to control the response received from a request or to create your own
            response objects.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Request interface allows you to create a request object that contains information about the request
            being made, such as the URL and headers.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Headers interface allows you to create HTTP headers that can be added to a request or response object.
        </li>
        <li>
            Requests can retrieve data using a GET request, or send data using a POST request.
        </li>
        <li>
            The FormData interface makes it easier to send data from forms.
        </li>
    </ol>
