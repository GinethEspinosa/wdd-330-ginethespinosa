    <h3>Ch14: HTML5 APIs.</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            HTML5.1 is the latest incarnation of the Hypertext Markup Language. It covers a variety of technologies,
            including several APIs that are accessible using JavaScript.
        </li>
        <li>
            data- attributes help to embed custom data into a web page that can then be used to enhance the user
            experience with JavaScript.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Web Storage API allows key-value pairs to be stored on the user’s device in a similar way to cookies,
            but without the same storage restrictions.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Geolocation API allows you to access the geographic coordinates of the user’s device, as long as the
            user gives permission.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Web Worker API can be used to perform computationally intensive tasks in the background, which helps to
            avoid websites becoming unresponsive.
        </li>
        <li>
            Websockets are a new protocol for communicating over the internet, and allow real-time, two-way
            communication.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Notification API allows you to display notifications on the user's system.
        </li>
        <li>
            The  audio and video elements can be employed to embed audio tracks and video clips in a web page. They
                    also have a Media API that can help control the playback using JavaScript.
        </li>
        <li>
            The canvas element can be used to dynamically draw geometric shapes, text, and images on a web page in
            real-time using JavaScript.
        </li>
        <li>
            A shim or polyfill is a piece of code that adds support of missing features to older browsers.
        </li>
    </ol>
        <h3>Ch12: Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Canvas.</b> With HTML5's Canvas API, we can draw anything we can imagine, all through JavaScript.
                This can improve the performance of our websites by avoiding the need to download images off the
                network. With canvas, we can draw shapes and lines, arcs and text, gradients and patterns. In addition,
                canvas gives us the power to manipulate pixels in images and even video.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>SVG.</b> SVG stands forScalable Vector Graphics, a specific file format that allows you to describe
                vector graphics using XML. A major selling point of vector graphics in general is that, unlike bitmap
                images (such as GIF, JPEG, PNG, and TIFF), vector images preserve their quality even as you blow them up
                or shrink them down. We can use SVG to do many of the same tasks we can do with canvas, including
                drawing paths, shapes, text, gradients, and patterns. There are also very useful open-source tools
                relevant to SVG, some of which we'll leverage in order to add a spinning progress indicator toThe HTML5
                Herald's geolocation widget.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Canvas versus SVG.</b> If you need to paint pixels to the screen and have no concerns about the
                ability to retrieve and modify your shapes, canvas is probably the better choice. If, on the other hand,
                you need to be able to access and change specific aspects of your graphics, SVG might be more
                appropriate.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Drag and Drop</b> This API allows us to specify that certain elements are draggable, and then specify
                what should happen when these draggable elements are dragged over or dropped onto other elements on the
                page.
            </li>
