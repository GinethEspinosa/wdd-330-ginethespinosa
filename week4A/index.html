                <h3>Ch11: Further Functions</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Functions have built-in properties such as length , but can have custom properties added.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All functions have call() and apply() methods that can invoke a function with the value of this bound to an object that is provided as an argument.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Immediately Invoked Function Expressions or IIFEs are functions that are enclosed in parentheses and immediately followed by double parentheses so they’re invoked. They are useful for namespacing variables and setting default values.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Functions are able to dynamically redefine themselves in the body of the function, depending on certain conditions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A recursive function will keep invoking itself until a certain condition is met.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A callback is a function that’s provided as an argument to another function.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Callbacks are frequently used in asynchronous programming as part of the event loop. This means that a program can continue to run in a single thread while waiting for another task to be completed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Promises can be used instead of callbacks to deal with multiple asynchronous actions in sequence. They also provide a nicer mechanism for handling errors.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Functions that return other functions are known as higher-order functions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A closure is the process of keeping a reference to a variable available outside the scope of the function it was originally defined in.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A generator is created by placing an asterisk character (*) after the function keyword.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A generator function will return an iterator object that provides a next() method, which returns the next value in a sequence that is defined in the generator function.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Functional programming involves breaking processes down into steps that can be applied as a series of functions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pure functions are functions that don't rely on the state of the code they are called from, have no side-effects, and always give the same result when given the same arguments (referential transparency).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Currying or partial application is the process of applying one argument at a time to a function. A new function is returned until all the arguments have been used.
                    </li>
                    
                </ol>
            </li>
            <h3>Ch8: Transforms and Transitions</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    CSS3: without a line of JavaScript or a single JPEG, you can tilt, scale, move, and even flip your elements with ease.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Transforms:</b> The CSS3 transform property lets you lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Translation:</b> Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down. The translate(x,y) function moves an element x from the left, and y from the top.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Scaling:</b> The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Transitions allow the values of CSS properties to change over time, essentially providing simple animations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Rotation:</b> The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Skew:</b> The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Animations:</b> You can define starting and ending states, but there’s no fine-grained control over any intermediate states.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Keyframes:</b> To animate an element in CSS, you first create a named animation, then attach it to an element in that element’s property declaration block. Animations in themselves don’t do anything; in order to animate an element, you’ll need to associate the animation with that element.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use animations and transitions where it makes sense, enhancing the user experience—and skip it everywhere else.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
