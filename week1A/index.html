    <h2>Week01</h2>
    <h3>Syllabus</h3>
    <p>This course is designed to give students the skills required to create web applications using HTML, CSS , and
        JavaScript. It is intended to help the student learn to do this without the aid of third-party frameworks or
        libraries. Because of this, the course focuses on how to solve larger, ill-structured business problems by
        designing and creating web applications.
    </p>
    <h3>Course Overview</h3>
    <p>This class has an unusual course design. It is designed introduce you to the tools, workflows, and problems
        common in modern Frontend Development. We will spend the first 4.5 weeks of the course in teams working on a
        project modeled off of real world projects. The goal is to create an environment where the instructor is your
        mentor rather than a lecturer, and your team is a source of strength instead of frustration. Using HTML5, CSS3,
        and JavaScript you will explore technologies and use them to resolve problems that arise naturally. You will
        also learn to find, evaluate, and select solutions to those same problems through creating Single Page Web
        applications.<br><br>For weeks 5-7 of the course you will further apply what you have learned by designing and
        completing a project of
        your choosing. This project will be with your team.<br><br>During the first 4.5 weeks your time will be spent on
        weekly reading assignments, weekly Team and Individual
        Activities, and additional tasks (found in a Trello board of which each team will make a copy) that add more
        functionality to our site. Each person in the team should have a goal of completing at least two Trello cards
        (tasks) per week.</p>
    <h3>Working in groups</h3>

    <p>During the assignment is necessary</p>
    <ol>
        <li>An excellent way to communicate</li>
        <li>A good way of tracking and assigning tasks</li>
        <li>A way to avoid stepping on each other's toes when working on similar areas of the project</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Here are a few tools that the pros use to accomplish those things:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Slack</li>
        <li>Trello</li>
        <li>Github</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Putting it Together</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Log in to Slack or Teams and see what updates there are from team members.</li>
        <li>Open Trello and look over the Backlog and the Doing lists.</li>
        <li>Assign myself to a new task and move it to Doing.</li>
        <li>Make sure to "Pull" from the code repository (either GitHub or Bitbucket) to get any changes my teammates
            might have finished.</li>
        <li>Open my editor and complete the Task I grabbed. (Complete means coded AND tested! Make sure you didn't break
            anything with your changes!)</li>
        <li>"Commit" and "Push" my code back up to the Repository for my teammates.</li>
        <li>Move the Task I just finished in Trello over to Done.</li>
        <li>Make any updates to Slack or Teams that your group might need to know about what you did.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3> Git It Together</h3>
    <p>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very
        large projects with speed and efficiency.

        Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like
        Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and
        multiple workflows.</p>
    <h3>Questions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Is localStorage a popular way to persist data in real world
            applications? Or is it just a work around when we don't want to deal
            with sessions, or even an actual database?
        </li>
        <li>Scss is a topic that I donâ€™t feel comfortable to use. Are we going to program every assignment in Scss to
            compile to css?</li>
        <li> How can we concatenate all CSS into one file for faster loading?</li>
        <li> This sound interesting, how can we Minify and Uglify JavaScript to reduce size?</li>
    </ol>
